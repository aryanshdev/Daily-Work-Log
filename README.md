- **Project distribution:**  
  - *Avtaarmusic‑Backend* – 1 h 50 m 04 s (≈50 %).  
  - *frontend* – 1 h 48 m 21 s (≈50 %).

**Top‑time‑consuming modules / libraries** (approx. share of total time)  

| Rank | Module / Library | Time (h m s) | % of total |
|------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Unnamed task / “mins” | 1 h 44 m 35 s | 9.34 % |
| 2 | `lucide‑react` | 1 h 29 m 25 s | 7.99 % |
| 3 | `express` | 1 h 25 m 03 s | 7.60 % |
| 4 | `user.model` | 1 h 14 m 41 s | 6.67 % |
| 5 | `client‑s3` | 56 m 46 s | 5.07 % |
| 6 | `react‑router‑dom` | 53 m 50 s | 4.81 % |
| 7 | `axios` | 51 m 41 s | ~4 % |

These seven items account for roughly **48 %** of the recorded work.

**Other notable contributors** (each ≈ 2–4 % of total):  

- `music‑metadata`, `user.types`, `bcryptjs`, `generateToken`, `stream`, `AuthContext` – each 2.8–3.8 % of total runtime.  
- Minor route/model modules (`auth.routes`, `media.model`, `favourite.routes`, etc.) each consume ~0.2 % of total time.

**Overall picture**  

- Work was split almost evenly between backend and frontend, with JavaScript being the dominant language.  
- The bulk of effort was spent on a handful of core libraries and modules (the top seven), which together represent nearly half of all logged time.  
- The remaining time is distributed across many smaller modules, each contributing only a few percent or less.
